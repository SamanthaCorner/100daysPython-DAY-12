# Guess the Number

* A text based game where the computer selects a number from 1 to 100 randomly and prompts the user to guess.

* Two levels of play are incorporated - easy and hard: hard = 5 attempts, easy = 10 attempts.

* After each guess the user will be advised whether the guess is too high or too low and how many attempts left.

* Global / constant variables are introduced in this lesson: they appear in UPPERCASE.
